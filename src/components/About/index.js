                        I am a GIS Full Stack Developer who gets excited about building impactful apps
                        with complex code to solve real-world problems. I am skilled in HTML/CSS,
                        JavaScript, modern JS libraries, UX/UI Design, RESTful API and specialize in the MERN Stack.
                        When it comes to work, I want to be involved in projects that I find challenging
                        alongside people that inspire me.

                        I received a Bachelors in Geographic Information Systems and minor in Informatics
                        from the University of Washington, Seattle, and most recently a certificate in Full Stack Web
                        Development from the UW Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. My
                        background is in customer based experience ranging from restaurant service to
                        working as a GIS Technician at a transportation planning consultant company.

                        When Iâ€™m not working I enjoy exploring beautiful PNW hikes, visiting Canada,
                        and finding new songs to add to my coding playlist.
